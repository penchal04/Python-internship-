In this code:

- We first import the `random` module to generate a random number for the user to guess.
- We set the `number_to_guess` variable to a random number between 1 and 100.
- We set the `number_of_guesses` variable to 10.
- We use a `while` loop to allow the user to guess the number until they run out of guesses.
- Inside the loop, we get the user's guess, check if it's correct, and provide hints if it's too high or too low.
- We decrement the `number_of_guesses` variable after each guess.
- If the user runs out of guesses, we reveal the correct number
